SFBPopovers
===========

This framework implements popover windows- windows that, to the user, logically belong to another window are visually
attached to the parent window.

Although the majority of the code was written by me, the inspiration came from two similar products:

1. MAAttachedWindow by Matt Gemmell [http://mattgemmell.com/2007/10/03/maattachedwindow-nswindow-subclass][1]
2. INPopoverController [https://github.com/indragiek/INPopoverController][2]

Each has its strong points, but in the end I decided to combine the best features of both into my own framework.
